#### Upload Programs via Uploader

1. Open the plugin "CocoBlockly Uploader".
<div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;text-align: center;"><img src="../media/intro_upload_icon.png" width="20%" /></div>

2. Open the webpage: http://cocorobo.hk/cocoblockly/dev/

3. After the plugin is successfully uploaded to CocoBlockly, "Plugin is connected successfully!" will be shown at the upper right of the interface.
<div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;text-align: center;"><img src="../media/intro_upload_1_en.png" width="40%" /></div>

  - At the same time, successful connection is also shown in the "Upload Area".

<div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;text-align: center;"><img src="../media/intro_upload_2_en.png" width="70%" /></div>

4. Connect the main controller to a computer via a USB data cable. The port name of the main controller will be shown after a short time.
  - **Note 1**: For more information on the main controller, please refer to [Apply Main Controller](/cocomod/main-controller)
  - **Note 2**ï¼šThe port of Windows usually begins with "COM" while the port of MacOS usually begins with "/dev/tty.usb".

 <div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;text-align: center;"><img src="../media/intro_upload_3_en.png" width="70%" /></div>

5. Click "Upload" and begin to upload the Arduino source code of the "Arduino Source Code" to the main controller. Three steps will be involved:

  - Compiling

<div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;text-align: center;"><img src="../media/intro_upload_4_en.png" width="70%" /></div>

  - Uploading

<div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;text-align: center;"><img src="../media/intro_upload_5_en.png" width="70%" /></div>

  - Upload successfully

<div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;text-align: center;"><img src="../media/intro_upload_6_en.png" width="70%" /></div>

6. The completion of the above three steps means that the program is successfully uploaded to the main controller.

  - **Note**: Similar to the "Verify code" of the Arduino IDE, the option of "Compile" is also provided here to test if the program is correctly written.
