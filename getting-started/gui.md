5. **Block Designing Area Tools**: Include the following functions: view adjustment, increase/decrease the block size and delete blocks.
6. **Block Source Code Reference Area**: This area shows the source code (C language) of block designing area. It is seldom used for the most part.
7. **Program Uploading Area**: This area is very important. Programs are sent to electronic modules in this area.
	- A: Uploader Connection: The box is checked with a green tick if the Uploader is connected; the box is checked with a yellow question mark if the Uploader is disconnected; Please make sure that the Uploader is connected while you are compiling a program.
	- B: There are two icon buttons here: One is for downloading the CocoBlockly Uploader; the other is the instruction for downloading and installing the Uploader.
	- C: Module port name: There is a name here when it is connected to the main controller or WiFi communication module. The name begins with "COM" in the Windows system and with "/dev/cu." in the macOS system.
	- D: CocoBlockly Mode Switch: You can switch programming mode by clicking here. And the blocks in the toolbar will also change accordingly.
	- E: Compile: Send the block program to Cloud for verification. If it is correct, "Compile successfully" will be shown here. Or "Compile failed" will be shown here.
