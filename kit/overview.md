# Course Kit Overview

You can use the modules in the kits and their corresponding materials in combination with 3D printing and programming to complete a hands-on project. The themes of the kits are different from one another, with each kit having its module, sensor, accessories and so on. Users can learn to use the electronic modules in the CocoMod better and faster through their matched courses.

> Note: For information on how to use CocoBlockly, you can refer to previous parts such as [Start to Use CocoBlockly](/getting-started/info), [CocoBlockly Interface](/getting-started/gui) and [Electronic Modules](/cocomod/overview).
